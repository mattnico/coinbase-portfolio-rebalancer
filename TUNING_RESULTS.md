# Regime Detector Tuning Results

## Summary

Tested 5 competing market regime detection methods and optimized the winner's parameters through systematic grid search.

## Initial Comparison (5 Methods)

Tested on **48 rolling windows** (365 days, 30-day windows, 7-day steps):

| Rank | Detector | Overall Accuracy | BULL | BEAR | NEUTRAL | Notes |
|------|----------|------------------|------|------|---------|-------|
| 🥇 1 | **Trend** | **89.58%** | 83.33% | 50.00% | 94.74% | Winner - momentum-based |
| 🥈 2 | Return | 85.42% | 100.00% | 100.00% | 81.58% | Perfect on extremes, too aggressive |
| 🥉 3 | Hybrid | 64.58% | 100.00% | 50.00% | 60.53% | Complex ≠ better |
| 4 | Drawdown | 54.17% | 83.33% | 75.00% | 47.37% | Too many false bulls |
| 5 | Volatility | 39.58% | 33.33% | 0.00% | 44.74% | Missed all bears! |

**Key Finding**: Simple trend-based momentum detection outperformed sophisticated multi-factor approaches.

## Threshold Optimization

Tested **196 threshold combinations** for TrendDetector to maximize accuracy and bear detection:

### 🏆 Optimal Configuration (Balanced)

```python
detector = TrendDetector(
    bull_threshold=0.6,   # %/day slope for bull market
    bear_threshold=-0.4   # %/day slope for bear market
)
```

**Performance**:
- Overall: **93.75%** (+4.17pp vs default)
- BULL: 66.67% (4/6 detected)
- BEAR: **75.00%** (3/4 detected - **+25pp improvement!**)
- NEUTRAL: **100.00%** (38/38 detected - perfect!)
- Confidence: 0.627 (0.647 when correct, 0.331 when wrong)
- **Zero false positives** on BULL or BEAR predictions

### 🛡️ Defensive Configuration (Max Bear Protection)

For users who want to **never miss a correction** (at slight cost to overall accuracy):

```python
detector = TrendDetector(
    bull_threshold=0.6,
    bear_threshold=-0.3    # More sensitive
)
```

**Performance**:
- Overall: 91.67% (-2.08pp vs balanced)
- BULL: 66.67% (4/6 detected)
- BEAR: **100.00%** (4/4 detected - catches ALL bears!)
- NEUTRAL: 94.74% (36/38 detected)
- Tradeoff: 2 false bear alarms (calls neutral→bear)

## Comparison: Default vs Optimized

| Metric | Default (0.5%, -0.5%) | Optimized (0.6%, -0.4%) | Improvement |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Overall Accuracy | 89.58% | **93.75%** | +4.17pp |
| BULL Accuracy | 83.33% | 66.67% | -16.66pp ⚠️ |
| BEAR Accuracy | 50.00% | **75.00%** | **+25pp** 🎯 |
| NEUTRAL Accuracy | 94.74% | **100.00%** | +5.26pp |

**Analysis**:
- Slight drop in BULL detection is acceptable (still catches 4/6)
- **Massive improvement in BEAR detection** is critical (catching corrections early saves money)
- Perfect NEUTRAL detection means we don't overreact to normal volatility

## Why These Settings Work

### Bull Threshold: 0.5% → 0.6%/day
- **Old**: +0.5%/day slope = +15% month = BULL
- **New**: +0.6%/day slope = +18% month = BULL
- **Effect**: Requires stronger confirmation before calling bull market
- **Benefit**: Reduces false bulls in choppy uptrends

### Bear Threshold: -0.5% → -0.4%/day
- **Old**: -0.5%/day slope = -15% month = BEAR
- **New**: -0.4%/day slope = -12% month = BEAR
- **Effect**: Triggers earlier when detecting downtrends
- **Benefit**: Switches to Stablecoin_Heavy portfolio faster, preserving capital

## Recommendations by Risk Profile

### Conservative (Capital Preservation)
→ Use **Defensive Config** (0.6%, -0.3%)
- Never misses a correction
- Switches to stablecoins quickly
- Acceptable 2% accuracy cost

### Balanced (Most Users)
→ Use **Optimal Config** (0.6%, -0.4%)
- Best overall accuracy (93.75%)
- Catches 3/4 bears (only missed 1)
- Perfect neutral detection

### Aggressive (Maximum Growth)
→ Use **Default Config** (0.5%, -0.5%)
- Stays in bull mode longer (83% bull detection)
- May lag on bear detection
- Maximizes exposure to upside

## Portfolio Strategy Mapping

Based on detected regime, switch to optimal portfolio allocation:

| Regime | Portfolio | Allocation | Why It Wins |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| BULL | Equal_Weight | 7 assets equally weighted | Maximizes diversification in uptrends |
| BEAR | Stablecoin_Heavy | Heavy USDC/stables | Capital preservation during corrections |
| NEUTRAL | Top_Three | BTC 40%, ETH 40%, SOL 20% | All-weather, lower volatility than equal |

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Integration ✅ Ready
- [x] Build regime detector
- [x] Test 5 competing methods
- [x] Optimize winning method
- [ ] Integrate into main bot (`src/main.py`)
- [ ] Add regime logging to transaction history

### Phase 2: Validation
- [ ] Backtest with real portfolio data
- [ ] Calculate actual returns with regime switching
- [ ] Compare vs static Top_Three portfolio
- [ ] Monitor live performance for 1-2 weeks

### Phase 3: Enhancements
- [ ] Add volatility override (if vol>80%, force BEAR)
- [ ] Implement regime transition detection (bull→bear more important)
- [ ] Confidence-weighted allocation (blend portfolios based on uncertainty)
- [ ] Add SMS/email alerts on regime changes
